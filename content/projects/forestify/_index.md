### Introduction
I worked on this startup as part of the [Hatchery](https://hatchery.engineering.utoronto.ca/) (Summer 2023), a startup incubator at the University of Toronto. In this program, undergrad students team up with MBA students and mentors from diverse fields, and we pitched every other week to refine our idea iteratively.

This idea evolved through multiple pivots. We started with drone reforestation, shifted to controlling invasive species, and eventually became interested in farming. During a discussion with US farmers, we learned about a major flaw in traditional insurance.

After a meteorological event devastated a significant portion of crops, it could take months for insurers to assess damage and pay out claims - a delay that poses serious risks for farmers. We explored ways to shorten this process using [parametric insurance](https://corporatesolutions.swissre.com/insights/knowledge/what_is_parametric_insurance.html). Our solution aimed to help parametric insurance companies access reliable data, streamlining payouts and bypassing some regulatory hurdles.

### Why It Didn't Work
Wrong team: The co-founders had divergent expectations, goals, and aspirations. The team was dysfunctional, which ultimately proved to be our biggest challenge. Additionally, we lacked experience with insurance legislation.
