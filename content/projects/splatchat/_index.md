### Introduction
I got inspired after using Niantic's Scaniverse, an app that captures 3D scenes by filming around using gaussian splatting, a cutting-edge 3D reconstruction technique. My main observation was that if people truly enjoyed these "splats," theyâ€™d prefer sharing them with friends and family rather than broadcasting on public profiles or feeds. In essence, I wanted to create the WhatsApp of 3D pictures, with Scaniverse as the Instagram counterpart.

With that idea in mind, I took a "build it first" approach. I hacked together a prototype in just three weeks and then invited my friends to test it. Typically, I focus on back-end, so this was my first time building a front-end for iOS and Android, as well as deploying my own API in the cloud.

### Tech Stack
- React Native: Used for building the mobile app for both iOS and Android.
- FastAPI: Handles the API and authentication.
- Google Cloud Compute: Hosts the API.
- Nginx: Manages routing and domain names.
- Docker: Packages the environment with all the Gaussian splatting dependencies.
- Runpod: Provides serverless GPU support to run Gaussian splatting.
- Gsplat: The tool that performs Gaussian splatting.

### Why it didn't work
I struggled to pinpoint a compelling use case. Even my own friends weren't motivated to use it. Capturing videos of scenes that are inherently static proved inconvenient, and ultimately, the concept didn't generate enough interest.
