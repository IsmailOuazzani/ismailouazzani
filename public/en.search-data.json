Our goal was to create a deep learning-based heuristic function that assesses board positions and integrates with a chess engine for gameplay.\nThe Challenge Robots performing real-world tasks often require human annotations to determine whether a task was completed successfully. This slows down development cycles and limits scalability. We explored an AI-driven approach to classify robot demonstration success using only video data and natural language instructions.\nOur Approach Collected 900,000+ games from the Lichess database, filtering only high-level (Elo 2000+) matches to ensure strategic depth. We then extracted 2 million board states for training.\nCode View on Github Project Report "},"title":"A Deep Learning Chess Heuristic for Atomic Chess"}}
